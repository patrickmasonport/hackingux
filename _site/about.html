<p>UX designers are more in demand and valuable to businesses than ever.</p>

<p>Bootcamps see this as an opportunity to extort hopeful designers and are overcharging students who want access to UX jobs.</p>

<p>What if we told you there’s another way.</p>

<p>You could get your foot in the door of your dream career without shelling out thousands of dollars just to learn the basics.</p>

<p>We’ve worked as UX designers with top companies around the world. We didn’t study design at university or do a bootcamp. We came up with our own framework for how to get our first UX jobs.</p>

<p>Over the past few years, we’ve trialled this framework with other designers who’ve been able to beat out bootcamp graduates to land their first UX jobs too.</p>

<p>This guide is that framework. It’s everything we needed to know to get those first jobs and everything we wish we’d known.</p>

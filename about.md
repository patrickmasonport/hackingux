# About #

UX designers are more in demand and valuable to businesses than ever.

Bootcamps see this as an opportunity to extort hopeful designers and are overcharging students who want access to UX jobs.

What if we told you there’s another way.

You could get your foot in the door of your dream career without shelling out thousands of dollars just to learn the basics.

We’ve worked as UX designers with top companies around the world. We didn't study design at university or do a bootcamp. We came up with our own framework for how to get our first UX jobs.

Over the past few years, we’ve trialled this framework with other designers who’ve been able to beat out bootcamp graduates to land their first UX jobs too.

This guide is that framework. It’s everything we needed to know to get those first jobs and everything we wish we’d known.
